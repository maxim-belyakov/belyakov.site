                "I was born in Moscow in 1995. Since I was a child, I've spent a lot of time in creative work: drawing, gluing, modeling. When my parents bought a computer, I began to spend hours in front of it. In the 8th grade I realized that I want to connect my life with programming and I started to learn my first programming language with a tutor.",
                "I graduated from Moscow Industrial University as a Bachelor of Computer Science in 2016 and by that time I was already working at the first company as a Web Developer. That was just a start and I had to keep improving my skills as the industry moved forward. A welcome challenge! Six months later I started to work at Cultural service Inc. as a Junior Developer and finished after 2,5 years as a Head of Frontend. Then I realized that I want to connect my life with my roots and went to Israel. Here I met the startup InLoop and started to work here as Senior Frontend Developer, being responsible for the entire frontend side of the project.",
                "My philosophy is to create things that could really help people. I try to create intuitive, accessible, beautiful, and fun digital products. Helping startups, small businesses, and agencies to acquire high-quality websites and an exceptional user experience."
