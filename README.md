# This is my site

Built with ReactJS (create-react-app)

## Right folder
The actual app is in the general folder, so you will need to cd into that to run `npm install`and `npm start` <br />
Also at this time you can just change the data object files/photos and deploy this as is. <br />
The eventual goal is a node-based dashboard with API endpoints that feeds this portfolio

## Basic design
Below is some basic sketch design, I'm not a designer but I can build pretty much anything designed(not by me). <br />
It's supposed to be a basic side bar and main content which is a "slider" that goes through projects. <br />
It is slated to be advanced, support dynamic content from API endpoints(portfolio dashboard) and will include filtering eg. between professional/personal projects.
