                "I was born in Moscow in 1995. Since my first years, I spent a lot of time in creative work: drawing, gluing, modeling. When my family bought a computer, I began to spend a lot of time on the computer. In the 8th grade I realised that I wanted to connect my life with programming and went with a tutor to learn my first programming language.",
                "I graduated from Moscow Industrial University in 2016 as a Bachelor of Computer Science and at this time already worked in my first company as Web Developer. That was just the start as I had to keep improving myself as the industry moved forward. A very welcome challenge! After a 6 months I began work in Cultural service Inc. as Junior Developer and finished after 2,5 yers as Head of Frontend. When I realised that I want to connect my life with my routes and went to Israel. Here I found the startup InLoop and working here as Senior Frontend Developer and responsible for the entire frontend side of the project.",
                "My philosophy is making things when it can really help people. I trying to build digital products that are intuitive, accessible, beautiful, and fun. Helping start-ups, small businesses, and agencies achieve high-quality websites and exceptional user experience."
